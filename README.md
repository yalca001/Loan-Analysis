# Loan-Approval-With-Machine-Learning
The purpose of this project is to help users to determine their chances of getting a loan. 
Lending companies normally have presences across various areas such as, urban, semi urban and rural. 
In order for individuals get the loan, banks have to validate their qualifications for the loans. 
However, doing this process manually can takes a lot of time. 
So,companies and banks try their best to automate the loan eligibility process base on customer (real time) information.
                 
Banks set eligibility criteria before taking on the risk of extending loans.  
We have used Machine Learning to predict the risk thus extension of loans.
                
To help individuals predicting their qualifications we used different models to dertime whether the Loan_Status is yes or no, 
and these are the programing languages we used;

Machine Learning 
Python/Jupyter Notebook
Flask App
Tableau
