LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION

The purpose of this project is to help users to determine their chances of getting a loan. Lending companies normally have presence across various areas such as, urban, semi urban and rural. In order for individuals to get a loan, banks have to validate their qualifications for the loans. However, doing this process manually can take a lot of time. So, companies and banks try their best to automate the loan eligibility process base on customer (real time) information.

Banks set eligibility criteria before taking on the risk of extending loans. We have used Machine Learning to predict the risk thus whether an individual would be qualified for the loans.

Therefore, using different characteristics, we examine how reliable is the Machine Learning model to predict whether the lending companies would extend credit to individuals by using Loan Status as the loan indicator, a yes or no.
